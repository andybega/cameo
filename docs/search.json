    "text": "Code: 010Description: All public statements expressed verbally or in action not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 011 to 017 cannot be made. Note that statements are typically subordinate events; events such as comments are coded as mere statements only when they do not further imply appeals, agreements, support, apologies, demands, disapprovals, rejections, threats, etc.Example: U.S. military chief General Colin Powell said on Wednesday NATO would need to remain strong.\n\n\n\nCode: 011Description: Explicitly decline or refuse to comment on a situation.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. The target could be who the source actor declines to make a comment to or about.Example: NATO on Monday declined to comment on an estimate that Yugoslav army and special police troops in Kosovo were losing 90 to 100 dead per day in NATO air strikes.\n\n\n\nCode: 012Description: Express pessimism, negative outlook.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. Only statements with explicit pessimistic components should be coded as 012; otherwise, default to 010.Example: Former West Germany Chancellor Willy Brandt said in a radio interview broadcast today he was skeptical over Moscow’s will to agree on limiting European-based nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nCode: 013Description: Express optimism, assurance, confidence.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. Only statements with explicit optimistic components should be coded as 013; otherwise, default to 010.Example: Turkish President Turgut Ozal said on Wednesday he was confident that the United States would remove irritants damaging relations between the two NATO allies.\n\n\n\nCode: 014Description: Review, reflect upon, or study policy option.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. There is no limitation on types of policies that could be under consideration.Example: Europe’s leading security forum is exploring the possibility of international patrols to monitor the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia’s border with Serbia, its envoy said on Friday.\n\n\n\nCode: 015Description: Non-apologetically claim responsibility, admit an error or wrongdoing, or retract a statement without expression of remorse.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. Remorseful acknowledgements should be coded as ‘Apologize’ (064) instead.Example: A Damascus-based Palestinian guerrilla group claimed responsibility on Saturday for attacks on Israeli troops from Jordan in the past two days.\n\n\n\nCode: 016Description: Discard or deny accusations or charges.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. The target for this event type is the party that introduces some accusation or charge against the source actor who denies responsibility.Example: The government of Liberia denied on Thursday charges by Ivory Coast that Monrovia is committing genocide.\n\n\n\nCode: 017Description: Engage in symbolic activities such as holding vigils, attending funerals, and laying wreath.Usage Notes: Use this event form for all symbolic acts, including those that imply empathy. Use 018 to code only empathetic comments (i.e. not actions).Example: NULL\n\n\n\nCode: 018Description: Express empathy, condolences, sympathy, understanding.Usage Notes: This event form refers exclusively to verbal acts or comments. Empathetic and other symbolic actions should be coded as 017 instead.Example: Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Saturday expressed condolences to the United States for the death of three American diplomats.\n\n\n\nCode: 019Description: Express common understanding, agreement, or accord.Usage Notes: This event form refers exclusively to verbal acts or comments. Use this code when actors indicate that they simply agree or concur on an issue but do not imply commitment or intent to cooperate on that issue. These are typically reciprocal events (see example below) and require coding of more than one 018 event with actors reversed.Example: President Reagan and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak agreed today there was an urgent need for progress towards a Middle East settlement and that a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territories was also needed. Note: Two reciprocal events (both 018) are coded with actors reversed."

    "title": "Verb Codebook",
    "section": "APPEAL",
    "text": "APPEAL\n\nMake an appeal or request\nCode: 020Description: All requests, proposals, suggestions and appeals not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 021 through 028 cannot be made. Events coded under this category refer to pleas made either on the source actor’s own behalf or on behalf of another party (i.e. the source asks that the target does something either for self or for a third party). Note that this and all the subcategories are distinct from demands, which are more forceful, and from pledges, which imply commitments, agreements, or promises on the part of the source actor.Example: NULL\n\n\nAppeal for material cooperation\nCode: 021Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest material cooperation.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, though not exclusively, a verbal act. It refers to appeals for material cooperation specifically; appeals for diplomatic cooperation, such as for the provision of support on a particular policy, are coded as 022 instead. (Note that the actual events of material cooperation are coded under category 06.)Example: Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi on Monday urged Uganda to to repatriate “all Kenyan criminals hiding there” to face trial, accusing them of killing Kenyan policemen in cross-border raids recently.\n\nAppeal for economic cooperation\nCode: 0211Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding economic ties.Usage Notes: Use this code for requests to develop or expand trade and other forms of economic exchange. Appeals for provision of economic aid-not mutual exchange-are coded as 0231 instead. Actual events of economic cooperation are coded as 061.Example: Indian business leaders Friday called for greater impetus towards free trade despite mounting tensions between India and Pakistan.\n\n\nAppeal for military cooperation\nCode: 0212Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding military ties.Usage Notes: Use this code for requests to develop or expand military relations by engaging in acts such as joint military maneuvers or exercises. Appeals for provision of military aid-not mutual exchange-are coded as 0232 instead. Actual events of military cooperation are coded as 062.Example: South Korea has requested to lease a Russian military training ground, military officers in Seoul said on Thursday.\n\n\nAppeal for judicial cooperation\nCode: 0213Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding cooperation in judicial matters.Usage Notes: Use this code for requests to develop or expand cooperation in such matters as extraditions. Appeals for information or other investigative tools, even if to be used in courts of law, are coded as 0214 instead. Note that in case of extraditions, the target for this event type is not the subject but the country he would be extradited to. Actual events of judicial cooperation are coded as 063.Example: Turkey renewed an appeal to Belgium to extradite a far-left militant wanted for murder, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Thursday, slamming what he called lax international cooperation against terrorism.\n\n\nAppeal for intelligence\nCode: 0214Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest sharing of intelligence.Usage Notes: Use this code for requests to develop or expand intelligence and information sharing. Actual events of intelligence cooperation are coded as 064.Example: Turkey said Monday it had asked Tehran and Damascus to provide urgent information about arms and ammunition seized last week in southeastern Turkey aboard six trucks travelling from Iran to Syria.\n\n\n\nAppeal for diplomatic cooperation (such as policy support)\nCode: 022Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest expansion of diplomatic ties or cooperation.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. It refers to appeals for expanded diplomatic ties and non-tangible support on particular policies. Appeals for more specific forms of diplomacy, such as mediation and negotiation, are coded elsewhere within category 02.Example: North Korean state media have called on the United States to forge “ties of confidence” with Pyongyang ahead of six-party nuclear talks expected to be held in Beijing on July 26.\n\n\nAppeal for aid\nCode: 023Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest provision of material assistance not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. The source could be requesting aid for itself or on behalf of a third party; in either case, the actor whom the request is directed to should be coded as the target. Note that only requests for or suggestions of material aid are coded under this category; events coded under 023 imply neither the receipt or delivery of material aid nor a commitment on the part of the source actor to provide such aid. For the latter two cases, refer instead to categories 07 and 033, respectively.Example: Romania has asked the European Community for immediate delivery of additional aid, EC sources said on Thursday.\n\nAppeal for economic aid\nCode: 0231Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest economic assistance.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Requests or suggestions for loans or debt relief are also coded here. Appeals for reciprocal economic exchange, such as trade, should be coded as 0212 instead. The source could be requesting support for itself or on behalf of another party.Example: Russia and China will ask Asian banks to help finance construction of an $8 billion Trans-Siberian natural gas link to China. Note: Because of the compound source (Russia and China), two events are coded.\n\n\nAppeal for military aid\nCode: 0232Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest military assistance.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Requests for or suggestions of joint military actions, rather than unilateral military aid, should be coded as 0212 instead.Example: Angola has asked Portugal for military aid, especially instructors for its Soviet-and Cuban-trained armed forces, a Lisbon newspaper said today.\n\n\nAppeal for humanitarian aid\nCode: 0233Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest humanitarian assistance.Usage Notes: Requests for or suggestions of food, medicine, and related personnel, as well as shelter and protection, are all coded as 0233. Calls by refugees to be let into the territories of other countries (which should be coded as targets) and asylum requests all fit here.Example: Oxfam Canada today called on the world community to help save tens of thousands of Afghan civilians threatened with starvation.\n\n\nAppeal for military protection or peacekeeping\nCode: 0234Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest deployment of peacekeepers or other military forces to preserve peace, enforce ceasefires, or protect civilians.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source actor could be making the appeal for itself or on behalf of another party; the target should represent the actor who is expected to provide the forces.Example: A group of prominent Liberians have written to President George Bush urging him to send U.S. peacekeeping troops to their capital Monrovia.\n\n\n\nAppeal for political reform\nCode: 024Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest political change not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for political change are coded under 104; expressions that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14. Source actors can be local citizens as well as international actors; they could be making the appeal on their own behalf or on behalf of others. Note that when the requested reform clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the target such as the easing of administrative sanctions, a more appropriate ‘Appeal’ code might be found under 025.Example: About 300 representatives from Egyptian civil society organizations submitted the most recent in a series of reform petitions, under the title “In Defense of the Nation” to the Saudi royal family.\n\nAppeal for change in leadership\nCode: 0241Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest change in leadership or power.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for leadership change are coded as 1041; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding change in leadership/power are coded under category 14. Note that even though calls for the target to resign or relinquish power are forms of yielding, they are still coded here. Also code appeals for elections here.Example: Members of parliament from Kenya’s Liberal Democratic Party called on Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi to resign in the wake of new evidence over the $7 billion scandals.\n\n\nAppeal for policy change\nCode: 0242Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest change in any particular policy.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for policy change are coded as 1042; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding change in leadership/power are coded under category 14. Just like the source actor, the policy in question can also be domestic or international in nature. If it is clear from the lead that by requesting certain policy changes the source is in fact appealing to the target to yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 035.Example: U.S. President George W. Bush said Friday that he will tell Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that Japan needs to enact significant economic reforms.\n\n\nAppeal for rights\nCode: 0243Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest provision or expansion of social, political, or other rights.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for rights are coded as 1043; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding certain rights are coded under category 14. If it is clear from the lead that by requesting certain rights the source is in fact appealing to the target to yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 025. Appeals for provision of compensation for previously violated rights, for instance, are coded as 025.Example: The UN urged the Maoists rebels in Nepal to honor human rights, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR).\n\n\nAppeal for change in institutions, regime\nCode: 0244Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest major institutional, constitutional, or regime change.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for institutional change are coded as 1044; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding such change are coded under category 14. Institutional change is different from policy change in that the former directly alters the rules of the game. Requests for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g. democratization) as well as for more limited institutional changes (e.g. changing electoral law) are coded here.Example: President Emile Lahoud has pushed the Lebanese Parliament for a new election law two days before he is to call parliamentary elections.\n\n\n\nAppeal to yield\nCode: 025Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target yields or concedes; not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event type may or may not be one of the adversaries; a third party could also be appealing to one or more of the parties in conflict (who are coded as targets) to yield. When the source itself expresses its intent to yield‚Äîrather than requesting it from another party‚Äîthe event should be coded under 035 instead. When yielding actually takes place, use the appropriate code under category 08.Example: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wants Germany to pay more compensation to the families of 11 Israeli athletes killed at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, a statement from his office said Tuesday.\n\nAppeal for easing of administrative sanctions\nCode: 0251Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target relaxes administrative restrictions.Usage Notes: Use this code when a government is requested to undertake some political changes that clearly constitute some form of concession or yielding, such as relaxing or removing bans or other restrictions that are already in place.Example: Dozens of journalists at Sudan’s most respected daily newspaper appealed to the Sudanese government on Wednesday to let them resume publishing and compensate them for lost wages.\n\n\nAppeal for easing of political dissent\nCode: 0252Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target stops political protest activities.Usage Notes: Use this code for requests for the target to stop engaging in protests, demonstrations, strikes, etc.Example: Islamic fundamentalist leaders appealed to their Muslim followers for an end to anti-government agitation, authorities said Monday.\n\n\nAppeal for release of persons or property\nCode: 0253Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target releases persons or property.Usage Notes: Use this code for requests for the target to release prisoners, hostages, and any confiscated property.Example: The United States called on Israel to move forward with its “courageous and historic” disengagement plan as fast as possible. Note: While “disengagement” does not necessarily involve any kind of release of persons or property, in the case of Israel we can safely assume that any mention of the “disengagement plan” refers primarily to the withdrawal of settlements, hence, the return of land to the Palestinians; phrases involving “disengagement” or “settlements” can be entered into verb dictionaries, particularly the Middle East dictionary, as the appropriate codes pertaining to the release of property.\n\n\nAppeal for easing of economic sanctions, boycott, or embargo\nCode: 0254Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target stops or eases economicUsage Notes: Use this code only for economic sanctions, boycotts, or embargoes.Example: Iraq on Saturday appealed to the U.N. to bring an end to their trade em\n\n\nAppeal for target to allow international involvement (non-mediation)\nCode: 0255Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target allows the entry of international actors, such as observers, humanitarian agencies, and peacekeeping forces.Usage Notes: Requests for adversaries to allow mediation are coded as 028 instead.Example: An international aid agency appealed to the Sudanese government on Friday to urgently reconsider its ban on relief flights to southern Sudan. Note: Because the identity of the agency is not provided, the general NGO code will be used.\n\n\nAppeal for de-escalation of military engagement\nCode: 0256Description: Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target stops fighting or takes measures to ease military conflict or tension.Usage Notes: Use this code for appeals for ceasefires, military withdrawals, and demobilization.Example: The presidents of Iraq and Egypt called on Tuesday for the withdrawal of Syrian and other foreign forces from Lebanon to end 14 years of civil war there. Note: Because of the compound source (governments of Iraq and Egypt), two events are coded.\n\n\n\nAppeal to others to meet or negotiate\nCode: 026Description: Propose or suggest meeting, negotiation, or discussion among other parties.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event cannot be the actors whose meeting or negotiation is called for; it has to be third parties who appeal to one or more actors‚Äî target actors‚Äîto meet and/or negotiate. When parties themselves express their intent to meet and/or negotiate, use 036 instead. When meetings or negotiations do take place, use the appropriate code under category 04.Example: El Salvador on Monday requested an urgent Security Council meeting on Wednesday to deal with what it called violations by Nicaragua of the Central American peace accords.\n\n\nAppeal to others to settle dispute\nCode: 027Description: Propose or suggest that others reach a settlement, agreement, or resolution of conflict.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Note that the source for this event cannot be the adversaries themselves. When one or more parties to a conflict call for ending the conflict, that is taken to be an expression of intent on the part of that source actor to reach a settlement and is thus coded as 037 instead.Example: The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said here Saturday that he urges Iran and the EU trio (France, Germany, and Britain) to reach an agreement in their talks on Iran’s nuclear program. Note: Given the presence of four different targets, four events are coded.\n\n\nAppeal to engage in or accept mediation\nCode: 028Description: Propose or suggest that target mediates or accepts the mediation of others.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Note that the source for this event cannot be the potential mediator or parties to the conflict. When an actor proposes to play the role of mediator himself, this is assumed to be a commitment on his part and is coded as 039 instead. When one or more of the adversaries request that another party plays the role of a mediator, this is understood to be a commitment on their part to accept mediation and is thus coded as 038. The target can either be a potential mediator (whose mediation is being requested) or one of the adversaries (who is requested to allow involvement of mediators).Example: The International Crisis Group has called on the UN stabilization mission in Haiti to broker an agreement among Haitians that “establishes common objectives for the next government.”"

    "section": "EXPRESS INTENT TO COOPERATE",
    "text": "EXPRESS INTENT TO COOPERATE\n\nExpress intent to cooperate\nCode: 030Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to cooperate not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 031 through 039 cannot be made. All cooperative actions reported in future tense are also taken to imply intentions, if not promises or commitments, to cooperate and are hence coded under this category. These events can be reciprocal or unilateral.Example: Senior Hungarian and Romanian officials agreed on Wednesday that their countries should cooperate to encourage Romanian refugees in Hungary to return home. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nExpress intent to engage in material cooperation\nCode: 031Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to engage in or expand material cooperative exchange not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. This event form refers to commitments or indications of intent by parties to boost their material exchange; they could be reciprocal or unilateral agreements, promises, commitments, or other indications of intent to cooperate. Pledges to provide unilateral material aid, however, are coded under category 033. Expressions of intent to engage in or further diplomatic cooperation, such as negotiations, settling disputes, or provision of policy support are coded elsewhere under category 03. Note that events coded here are intents and commitments, and not actual events of cooperation, which should be coded under 06.Example: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum has agreed to set up an energy research center in Tokyo to further develop its regional energy projections, officials said Thursday.\n\nExpress intent to cooperate economically\nCode: 0311Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to engage in or expand economic ties.Usage Notes: This event form refers to agreements, promises, commitments, or other indications of intent to develop or expand trade and other forms of economic exchange. Offers, promises, or commitments by one actor to provide economic aid to another should be coded as 0331 instead.Example: The United States and Jordan have agreed upon a new free-trade pact between the two countries, the White House announced Tuesday. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nExpress intent to cooperate militarily\nCode: 0312Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to engage in or expand military ties.Usage Notes: This event form refers to agreements, promises, commitments, or other indications of intent to develop or expand military relations by engaging in such acts as joint military maneuvers or exercises. Offers, promises, or commitments by one actor to provide military aid to another should be coded as 0332 instead.Example: Jordan and Britain have agreed to undertake joint military exercises this month, a Jordanian official confirmed. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nExpress intent to cooperate on judicial matters\nCode: 0313Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to engage in or expand judicial cooperation.Usage Notes: This event form refers to agreements, promises, commitments, or other indications of intent to develop or expand judicial cooperation by engaging in such acts as extraditions.Example: Libya has offered to hand over to an Arab country two of its nationals suspected by the West of blowing up a Pan Am plane in 1988, a state-owned Egyptian newspaper said.\n\n\nExpress intent to cooperate on intelligence\nCode: 0314Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to engage in or expand intelligence sharing.Usage Notes: This event form refers to agreements, promises, commitments, or other indications of intent to develop or expand intelligence cooperation by providing or exchanging intelligence or information.Example: Israel and the Palestinians reached a consensus to exchange information on water resources on the second day of a multilateral conference on water problems in the Middle East here Thursday, the meeting’s co-chairman said. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\n\nExpress intent to engage in diplomatic cooperation (such as policy support)\nCode: 032Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to expand diplomatic ties or cooperation.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The offered or promised support should be non-material, such as supporting or backing particular policies and/or goals. Note that agreements or promises to engage in more specific forms of diplomatic cooperation, such as negotiations and mediation, are coded elsewhere under category 03. The target should be the recipient of the potential support.Example: Portugal will support Turkey’s efforts to become a full member of the European Community, Portuguese President Mario Soares said on Tuesday. Note: Note that the future tense used in the lead indicates future commitment.\n\n\nExpress intent to provide material aid\nCode: 033Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to provide some form of material support not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. Note that more general commitments to broaden material exchange or cooperation are coded under 031 instead. Reported deliveries of material support are coded under category 07. The target should be the prospective recipient of aid.Example: NATO-member Norway is willing to send material to help defend Saudi Arabia if it is attacked, Norway’s foreign minister said.\n\nExpress intent to provide economic aid\nCode: 0331Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to provide economic support.Usage Notes: Code commitments to provide financial support, in form of grants, loans, or debt relief under this event code. Trade commitments should be coded as 0311 instead.Example: Finland will give Tanzania a grant of 580 million shillings (64.45 million dollars) over the next three years to finance several projects in the country, a statement issued by the ministry of finance said today. Note: Note that the future tense used in the lead indicates future commitment.\n\n\nExpress intent to provide military aid\nCode: 0332Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to provide military support.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code commitments to provide all forms of military aid. Promises to engage in bilateral or multilateral military cooperation should be coded as 0312 instead.Example: British Defence Secretary Tom King has promised to continue military aid to war-torn Mozambique.\n\n\nExpress intent to provide humanitarian aid\nCode: 0333Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to provide humanitarian support.Usage Notes: Use this code for commitments to provide all forms of humanitarian aid, including evacuations from dangerous zones and shelter for refugees. However, note that expressions of intent to provide military security or peacekeeping forces are coded as 0334 instead. Actual provisions of humanitarian aid are coded as 073.Example: The United Nations will provide nearly 25,000 tons of emergency food aid to refugees fleeing the civil war in Liberia, the World Food Program (WFP) said on Monday.\n\n\nExpress intent to provide military protection or peacekeeping\nCode: 0334Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to deploy peacekeeping or other military forces for security.Usage Notes: Source actor for this event is the party making the commitment to provide forces, while the target represents the prospective location of deployment. Actual deployments should be coded as linked events ‘Provide military protection or peacekeeping’ (074) and ‘Receive deployment of peacekeepers’ (0861) with actors reversed. Commitments by adversaries to accept peacekeepers should be coded as 0355.Example: France is ready to contribute up to 4,000 troops to an international peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia, Defence Minister Pierre Joxe said on Monday.\n\n\n\nExpress intent to institute political reform\nCode: 034Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to institute political change not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: If the promised reforms clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the source, such as the easing of existing administrative sanctions, a more appropriate code might be found under 035. If there are specific groups or individuals asking for that change and that information is codeable given the structure of the lead, those actors should be coded as targets; otherwise, the country in general or actors to be affected by the change should be coded as the target.Example: NULL\n\nExpress intent to change leadership\nCode: 0341Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to change leadership or relinquish power.Usage Notes: Commitments to resign or hand over power, as well to hold elections that might open the way for change in leadership, are coded here. Note that while commitments for other forms of yielding are coded under 035, commitments to give up power are coded here.Example: Ousted President Askar Akayev has agreed to resign without returning to the Kyrgyzstan, the Parliament speaker said Saturday. Note: Because no specific group is mentioned, the country alone is coded as the target.\n\n\nExpress intent to change policy\nCode: 0342Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment for policy change.Usage Notes: Use this code for commitments to bring policy change‚Äîpolitical, economic, military, social, or otherwise. If the policy change in question clearly represents a form of yielding, the appropriate code under 035 should be used instead.Example: Planning and Investment Minister Tran Xuan Gia said Vietnam is committed to opening up the economy but will not be rushed, in a rare interview late on Friday. Note: Vietnam can be coded as the target since the country in general is obviously going to be affected from such a change in policy.\n\n\nExpress intent to provide rights\nCode: 0343Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to provide social, political, economic, or other rights and freedoms.Usage Notes: If it is clear from the lead that by promising to provide certain rights the source is in fact committing to yield, the event might be better coded under 035. Commitments to provide compensation for previously violated rights, for instance, are coded as 035.Example: Turkey will allow up to 13,000 Turkish Kurd refugees who have lived in Iraq for more than a decade to return home as part of a UN-brokered deal. Note: Allowing the voluntary repatriation of refugees constitutes provision of the right to go home.\n\n\nExpress intent to change institutions, regime\nCode: 0344Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to make fundamental political changes, such as moving from one type of political system to another and reforming political institutions or key laws.Usage Notes: Note the difference between institutional/regime changes and policy reforms.Example: Serbian President Vojislav Kostunica promised to democratize Serbia and establish the rule of law as he succeeded Milosevic.\n\n\n\nExpress intent to yield\nCode: 035Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to yield not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event form refers to general expressions of willingness or commitment to concede; use the subcategories for more detailed coding. The actual events of yielding are coded under category 08.Example: A Soviet official offered concessions last November that U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze believed could lead to an agreement on reducing nuclear missiles in Europe, according to a senator who acted as a go-between at the talks.\n\nExpress intent to ease administrative sanctions\nCode: 0351Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to ease administrative sanctions, such as censorship, curfew, state of emergency, and martial law.Usage Notes: NULLExample: In an interview this weekend, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he is prepared to lift ban on Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) but not with its historical leadership.\n\n\nExpress intent to ease popular dissent\nCode: 0352Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to reduce or stop political protest activities, such as demonstrations and rallies.Usage Notes: NULLExample: Leaders of the Azadliq (Freedom) opposition coalition agreed to postpone the demonstration in Baku until 9 November.\n\n\nExpress intent to release persons or property\nCode: 0353Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to release or return persons or property.Usage Notes: Commitments to release or exchange prisoners and hostages, as well as commitments to return previously confiscated properties, are coded here.Example: The Fijian rebels said they will release Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than 30 members of his government, whom they had taken hostage two weeks ago, on the weekend.\n\n\nExpress intent to ease economic sanctions, boycott, or embargo\nCode: 0354Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment toUsage Notes: Use this code only for economic sanctions, boycotts, or embargoes.Example: The US Congress agreed to lift embargoes on pharmaceutical sales in late Note: Due to the compound target, five separate events are coded.\n\n\nExpress intent to allow international involvement (non-mediation)\nCode: 0355Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to allow access to international actors, such as observers, humanitarian agencies, and peacekeeping forces.Usage Notes: Prospective peacekeepers, observers, etc. are coded as targets. Commitments to accept mediation by third parties are coded as 038 instead.Example: Ethopia has agreed to re-open its borders to UN peackeepers, who are depolyed in the region to oversee a ceasefire between Ethiopia and its neighbor, Eritrea.\n\n\nExpress intent to de-escalate military engagement\nCode: 0356Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to stop fighting or take measures to ease military conflict or tension.Usage Notes: Use this code for appeals for ceasefires, military withdrawals, and demobilization.Example: Yugoslavia and Slovenia agreed to a ceasefire after two days of fierce fighting but media reports said sporadic clashes were still continuing. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\n\nExpress intent to meet or negotiate\nCode: 036Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to meet, visit, or engage in talks or negotiations.Usage Notes: This event code refers to future commitments to meet and/or negotiate; when meetings, negotiations, or other talks do take place, those are coded under category 04 instead. When mediation is mentioned specifically, appropriate mediation-related codes take precedence over meetings or negotiations.Example: East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer will visit Albania in June, the first Warsaw Pact foreign minister to do so since Tirana split with Moscow in 1961, the Albanian embassy said. Note: Given the wording of this lead, which implies that Albania has already committed to receive the German minister, two reciprocal events of 038 are coded with actors reversed. This example fits under this category since the future tense used implies a future commitment to meet.\n\n\nExpress intent to settle dispute\nCode: 037Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to reach a comprehensive settlement, agreement, or resolution to conflict.Usage Notes: Note that specific commitments to yield, which might be present steps to settling disputes, are coded elsewhere under category 03. Both the source and the target for this event type should be adversaries themselves. When other parties make appeals to end disputes in which they are not directly involved, use ‘Appeal to others to settle dispute’ (027) instead.Example: Denmark today accepted a formula for ending its fisheries dispute with its European common market partners, government officials said.\n\n\nExpress intent to accept mediation\nCode: 038Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to accept mediation.Usage Notes: This code represents adversaries’ commitments to receive mediation by third parties. The latter should be coded as targets, while the source has to be one or more of the parties in conflict for this event. Note that when reports involve references to mediation specifically, mediation-related codes such as this take precedence over others, such as ‘Agree to meet or negotiate,’ ‘Make a visit,’ ‘Host a visit,’ and ‘Meet at a third location.’ For commitments by third parties to mediate refer to code 039 instead. For simple suggestions by actors other than adversaries and potential mediators that mediation occurs, use ‘Appeal to others to engage in or accept mediation’ (028).Example: Afghan rebel leaders said on Wednesday they would meet U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez if he gave them a veto over any settlement reached in peace talks.\n\n\nExpress intent to mediate\nCode: 039Description: Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to play the role of a mediator.Usage Notes: This code represents a commitment by third parties to mediate between parties in conflict. The former should be coded as source and the later as targets for this event. Note that when reports involve references to mediation specifically, mediation-related codes such as this take precedence over others, such as ‘Agree to meet or negotiate,’ ‘Make a visit,’ ‘Host a visit,’ and ‘Meet at a third location.’ For commitments of adversaries to accept mediation by actors other than the adversaries and potential mediators that mediation occurs, refer to ‘Appeal to others to engage in or accept mediation’ (028).Example: Gambian President Dawda Jawara will visit Mauritania and Senegal to mediate in a border dispute between the two West African neighbors, diplomatic sources said on Wednesday. Note: Given the wording used in this particular lead, which implies that Mauritania and Senegal have already agreed to Gambia’s mediation, two types of linked events are coded‚Äî’Express intent to mediate’ (036) with the Gambian president as the source, and ‘Express intent to accept mediation’ (035) with Mauritania and Senegal as sources. Two different events are coded for each of these event types since Mauritania and Senegal are compound actors."

Note that events coded under 04 are typically, although not always, reciprocal events.Example: A group of African diplomats held their first meeting with President Parvanov at a lunch hosted by the Ambassador of Kingdom of Morocco. Note: This lead is coded as 040 since the place of the meeting is not explicit in the lead, hence we cannot code it as a visit made or hosted, and no negotiations are implied (so, we cannot code it as ‘Engage in negotiation’).\n\n\nDiscuss by telephone\nCode: 041Description: Consult, talk on the telephone.Usage Notes: This is typically a reciprocal event. The nature of the phone conversation is not of significance.Example: U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Tuesday to discuss efforts to forge a peace settlement in former Yugoslavia, Itar-Tass news agency said. Note: Two events of the same type are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nMake a visit\nCode: 042Description: Travel to another location for a meeting or other event.Usage Notes: All visits and travels should be coded under this category. Note that this event is typically accompanied by the linked event ‘Host a visit’ (043). If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings.Example: Taiwan’s Vice Foreign Minister visited Russia today, becoming the island’s highest ranking government official to go there. Note: Two events are coded: 042 with the Taiwanese government as the source and Russia as the target, and 043 with actors reversed.\n\n\nHost a visit\nCode: 043Description: Host or receive a visitor at residence, office or home country.Usage Notes: This event is typically accompanied by the linked event ‘Make a visit’ (042). If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings.Example: Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday hosted Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in this Siberian city for an informal meeting aimed at establishing close personal relations between the two leaders. Note: Two events are coded: 043 with the Russian government as the source and the Japanese government as the target, and 042 with the actors reversed.\n\n\nMeet at a ‘third’ location\nCode: 044Description: Meet, come together, gather with others at a neutral location, some place with which none of the attending parties are associated. If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings.Usage Notes: This event type is typically accompanied by two other linked events, ‘Make a visit’ (042) and ‘Host a visit’ (043), and the event itself is reciprocal. For 044, the source and the target are the actors who are meeting; the location of the meeting is ignored.Example: U.S. and Soviet negotiators return to Geneva this week for talk on limiting the number of European-based nuclear missiles, an issue likely to dominate East-West relations this year. Note: Six events are coded: two reciprocal ‘Meet at a third location’ events with US and the Soviet Union as actors; two ‘’Make a visit’ events with Switzerland as the target, and the US and the Soviet Union as the two different sources; and two ‘Host a visit’ events with Switzerland as the source and the US and the Soviet as the two different targets.\n\n\nMediate\nCode: 045Description: Mediate between two or more parties.Usage Notes: This event code should be used only when a party meets with others explicitly as a mediator. The source is always the mediator and adversaries are the targets. All other cases of meetings and negotiations, where the purpose of the meeting or the role of the source actor is not specified, should be coded elsewhere under category 04. If meetings, discussions, or negotiations are explicitly reported as involving mediators, the mediation code takes precedence as long as the party acting as the mediator is identified in the lead.Example: Arab League Secretary General Chadli Klibi undertook mediation mission between Syria and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Note: Because of the compound target actor, two events are coded.\n\n\nEngage in negotiation\nCode: 046Description: Negotiate or bargain with others.Usage Notes: This event code should be used only when the report makes clear that negotiations, bargaining, or discussions are involved in the meetings or consultations in question. “Holding talks” and “discussions” are treated as negotiations. These are reciprocal events.Example: Israel and Lebanon renewed negotiations today on an Israeli troop pullback from Lebanon and their future relations. Note: Two 046 events are coded with actors reversed."

Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nPraise or endorse\nCode: 051Description: Express support for, commend, approve policy, action, or actor.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act.Example: A top U.S. official today praised Haiti’s efforts to improve its record on\n\n\nDefend verbally\nCode: 052Description: Defend verbally, justify policy, action or actor.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. Use this code only for political, diplomatic, and non-material defense; military cooperation or defense should be coded elsewhere.Example: The United States on Thursday defended the right of Soviet troops to fire protectively on militants in Azerbaijan and insisted unrest there reflected age-old ethnic tensions, not a fight for political independence.\n\n\nRally support on behalf of\nCode: 053Description: Call on other parties to support the target.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act.

Formal pardons and amnesties of arrested persons, as well as the release or exchange of prisoners, should be coded as CAMEO 0831 instead.Example: A group of Yoruba leaders announced yesterday that they are willing to forgive President Olusegun Obasanjo and queue behind him for a second term.\n\n\nSign formal agreement\nCode: 057Description: Ratify, sign, finalize an agreement, treaty.Usage Notes: This category excludes promises to sign or ratify agreements and treaties. Events should be coded under this category only when agreements are reportedly finalized or signed. This event code is typically reciprocal. Even when the agreement in question implies a formal commitment to boost material cooperation, provide aid, or yield in some way, the event of signing the agreement or treaty is still coded here since signing of an agreement or treaty represents diplomatic cooperation but does not guarantee implementation‚Äî whatever its terms.Example: Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov today signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, the BTA reported. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed."

Unilateral and potentially altruistic provisions of aid should be coded under ‘Provide Aid’ (07) instead.Example: French and Egyptian warships on Monday launched 10 days of war games in the Mediterranean Sea, expected to be joined later by Italian and German vessels, the French embassy said Monday. Note: Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nEngage in judicial cooperation\nCode: 063Description: Initiate, resume, improve, or expand judicial cooperation.Usage Notes: This code represents cooperation on judicial matters, such as extraditions and war crimes.Example: Zambia extradited suspected British militant Haroon Rashid Aswad to Britain on Sunday, a senior Zambian government official said.

The target for an 084 event should be the actor providing the peacekeepers. Note that this event form is accompanied by the linked event ‘Provide military protection or peacekeeping’ (074).Example: A first patch of Bangladeshi peacekeeping troops arrived in Sierra Leone Tuesday, joining 12 unarmed military observers as the first element of an 800-strong Bangladeshi contingent due here, U.N. officials said. Note: Two linked events (0861 and 074) are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nReceive inspectors\nCode: 0862Description: Allow, receive inspectors in territories controlled by the source actor.Usage Notes: Code here reported deployment or arrival of inspectors; mere promises or agreements to accept their deployment should be coded as 0355 instead. The target for an 085 event should be the inspectors or the country/agency providing them. This event form is typically accompanied by code under category 09.Example: The IAEA has dispatched inspectors to Esfahan Uranium Conversion Facilities (UCF) in central Iran to monitor resumption of peaceful nuclear work at the plant. Note: Two linked events (0862 and 090) are coded with actors reversed.\n\n\nAllow humanitarian access\nCode: 0863Description: Allow access to, receive humanitarian agencies in territories controlled by the source actor.Usage Notes: Mere promises to allow such access should be coded as 0355. Note that this event form is accompanied by the linked event ‘Provide humanitarian aid’ (073) if the target is the humanitarian agency; in some cases the target would be the particular area that is given access.Example: Humanitarian access for the Darfur region has improved significantly since September as the Khartoum government tried to secure international favor.\n\n\n\nDe-escalate military engagement\nCode: 087Description: Concede militarily, stop fighting, or take measures to ease military conflict or tension not further specified.Usage Notes: Use sub-categories for more detailed coding whenever possible. Note that only real manifestations of de-escalation are coded here, expressions of intent to de-escalate are not.Example: NULL\n\nDeclare truce, ceasefire\nCode: 0871Description: Declare or observe truce or ceasefire to interrupt fighting.Usage Notes: Although mere declarations of ceasefire, or agreements to commence a cease-fire, do not guarantee that military engagement is actually halted, they are still coded here. The target could be the location for the ceasefire or the opponent.Example: The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) group declared a unilateral cease-fire on Wednesday in south Lebanon after 12 days of battles with the Syrian-backed Amal militia.\n\n\nEase military blockade\nCode: 0872Description: Lessen or halt use of armed (military, police, or security) forces to seal off a territory to prevent exit or entry of goods and/or people.Usage Notes: NULLExample: The Israeli army lifted Friday a day-old blockade on Palestinian lorries passing through this crossing point between the Gaza Strip and the Jewish state, officials told AFP.\n\n\nDemobilize armed forces\nCode: 0873Description: Hand over or otherwise reduce or eliminate arms, weapons; discharge soldiers or other armed personnel.Usage Notes: The source actor for this event is the demobilizing party; the target is either the party against whom the source was formerly fighting or the actor to whom weaponry is turned in.Example: One third of ethnic Albanian guerrillas operating in Macedonia have been demobilized since the August 13 peace accord between Macedonian and ethnic Albanian political parties, two rebel commanders told AFP by phone Sunday.\n\n\nRetreat or surrender militarily\nCode: 0874Description: Retreat, withdraw, yield control of a location or territory by pulling out armed forces.Usage Notes: Note that the yielding should involve a comprehensive military disengagement, at least from a certain area of contention.Example: Five hundred Ugandan rebels surrendered last week in the eastern town in Soroti followin a government offensive in the area, a local official said."

    "text": "INVESTIGATE\n\nInvestigate\nCode: 090Description: All non-covert investigations not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 091-094 cannot be made. Also note that category 09 should be used only when investigations are being or have been carried out. Investigation of historical cases should also be coded here.Example: The United Nations has sent 21 military and civilian personnel to Yugoslavia on Wednesday to investigate the feasibility of a 10,000-member peacekeeping force, a U.N. spokesman said on Monday.\n\n\nInvestigate crime, corruption\nCode: 091Description: Question or inquire criminal (theft, killing, etc) or corruption cases.Usage Notes: NULLExample: Judge Alejandro Rivera opened fraud investigations against 28 Chilean government officials suspected of taking kickbacks, the court said Friday.\n\n\nInvestigate human rights abuses\nCode: 092Description: Inquire or search into human rights abuses such as rape, torture, targeted assassinations, and violations of basic freedoms.Usage Notes: Investigations of war crimes are coded as 094 instead. Alleged or potential perpetrators should be coded as targets.Example: Members of the Association of African Jurists, a body linked to the Organization of African Unity, investigated welfare of nearly 2,000 Libyans, some of whom have been held as long as seven years.\n\n\nInvestigate military action\nCode: 093Description: Inquire or search into military activities such as violations of ceasefire, seizures, and invasions.Usage Notes: If military actions in question involve potential human rights violations or war crimes specifically, code them as 092 or 094 instead.

    "title": "Verb Codebook",
    "section": "DEMAND",
    "text": "DEMAND\n\nDemand\nCode: 100Description: All demands and orders not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 101-108 cannot be made. Note that demands are stronger or more forceful and potentially carry more serious repercussions‚Äîalthough not as much as threats‚Äîthan simple appeals. We rely primarily on the language used by reporters to make this distinction. All demands are verbal acts.Example: Poland’s parliament has demanded an immediate admission by Moscow that Soviet NKVD security forces murdered more than 15,000 captive Polish officers during World War Two.\n\n\nDemand material cooperation\nCode: 101Description: Require, demand that target engages in some form of material exchange.Usage Notes: Use the following sub-categories whenever possible. Demands for judicial cooperation, such as extradition of criminals, or compliance with requirements of an investigation are coded here.Example: French President Jacques Chirac issued a stern reminder Saturday to Iraq that it must cooperate fully with UN inspectors probing suspect sites for weapons of mass destruction.\n\nDemand economic cooperation\nCode: 1011Description: Require, demand that target engages in economic exchange or expands such ties.Usage Notes: Use this code for demands for economic activities such as trade and investment.

Demands for provision of military aid‚Äînot mutual exchange‚Äîare coded as 1032 instead.Example: The PRC on Tuesday demanded that the US cancel plans to sell air-tosurface anti-tank weapons to Taiwan to avoid “new damage” to US-PRC relations. Note: While the requested policy does not directly involve material exchange between the source and the target, the former is clearly demanding cooperation on military issues.\n\n\nDemand judicial cooperation\nCode: 1013Description: Require, demand that target engages in or expands cooperation in judicial matters.Usage Notes: Use this code for demands that target engages in judicial cooperation, such as through extraditing wanted individuals.Example: A senior British minister reiterated that Libya must hand over alleged bombers of the U.S. airliner as he embarked on a trip to North Africa to seek Arab support for the demand.\n\n\nDemand intelligence cooperation\nCode: 1014Description: Require, demand that target exchanges intelligence or information.Usage Notes: Use this code for demands that target engages in intelligence cooperation, including but not limited to the exchange of information in security matters.Example: The rebel Kurdistan Workers’ Party issued a declaration demanding that the Turkish government provide information information on the safety of its leader Abdullah Ocalan.\n\n\n\nDemand diplomatic cooperation (such as policy support)\nCode: 102Description: Require, demand expansion of diplomatic ties or cooperation.Usage Notes: This code refers to demands for expanded diplomatic ties and non-tangible support on particular policies. Demands for more specific forms of diplomacy, such as mediation and negotiation are coded elsewhere within categoryExample: Kosovo Municipality Association (AKK) officials demanded support from the Kosovo Assembly in regaining control over the properties that belonged to them before.\n\n\nDemand material aid\nCode: 103Description: Require, demand provision of material assistance not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. The source could be demanding aid for itself or on behalf of a third party; in either case, the actor who is expected to provide assistance should be coded as the target.Example: The Third World Water Forum concluded on Saturday that the US and other developed nations must allocate greater financial resources to help with the battle against the global water and sanitation crisis.\n\nDemand economic aid\nCode: 1031Description: Require, demand provision of economic assistance.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Demands for loans or debt relief are also coded here. Demands for reciprocal economic exchange, such as trade, should be coded as 1011 instead.Example: According to reports the UK is pushing hard for the US support its debt relief plan to tackle poverty in Africa.\n\n\nDemand military aid\nCode: 1032Description: Require, demand provision of military assistance.Usage Notes: Note that demands for military security and deployment of peacekeepers are coded as 1034 instead. heightExample: NULL\n\n\nDemand humanitarian aid\nCode: 1033Description: Require, demand provision of humanitarian aid.Usage Notes: Demands by refugees to be let into the territories of other countries (which should be coded as targets) and asylum demands all fit here. These are not necessarily verbal acts; refugees could be actively seeking shelter or refuge in target countries or regions.Example: Some 800,000 Iraqi Kurds sought refuge in Germany last month.\n\n\nDemand military protection or peacekeeping\nCode: 1034Description: Require, demand that the target provides military protection or peacekeeping forces.Usage Notes: The source that demands peacekeepers could demand that for itself or on behalf of another party.Example: Ethnic Albanians in south Serbia are demanding a U.N. military presence to protect them against a heavily armed ruling Serb minority and prevent a Bosnia-style civil war, but some foreign monitors are skeptical.\n\n\n\nDemand political reform\nCode: 104Description: Require, demand political change not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Source actors can be local citizens as well as international actors; they could be making the appeal on their own behalf or on behalf of others. Note that when the requested reform clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the target, such as the easing of administrative sanctions, a more appropriate “Demand” code might be found under 105.Example: At the end of a seminar on reform, around 100 Arab intellectuals and activists published a declaration demanding wide-ranging political changes in the Arab world.\n\nDemand change in leadership\nCode: 1041Description: Require, demand change in leadership or power.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Note that even though demands for the target to resign or relinquish power are forms of yielding, they are still coded here. Also code demands for elections here (unless they are first-time elections and hence constitute major institutional change).Example: Sunnis have demanded that control of the Interior Ministry be taken away from Shiite religious parties in the next government.\n\n\nDemand policy change\nCode: 1042Description: Require, demand change in any particular policy.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Just like the source actor, the policy in question can also be domestic or international in nature. If it is clear from the lead that by demanding certain policy changes the source is in fact appealing to the target to yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 105 (e.g. demands for military withdrawal should be coded as 1056).Example: Opposition groups in Zimbabwe are demanding that President Mugabe abandon his controversial policy of land confiscations.\n\n\nDemand rights\nCode: 1043Description: Require, demand provision or expansion of social, political, or other rights.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. If it is clear from the lead that by demanding certain rights the source is in fact appealing to the target to yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 105. Demands for provision of compensation for previously violated rights, for instance, are coded as 105.Example: The main Hutu rebel group, Forces for Defence of Democracy (FDD), insisted on its demands that Burundi’s government grant the Hutu majority more rights.\n\n\nDemand change in institutions, regime\nCode: 1044Description: Require, demand major institutional, constitutional, or regime change.Usage Notes: This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Institutional change is different from policy change in that the former directly alters the rules of the game. Demands for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g. democratization) as well as more limited institutional changes (e.g. changing electoral law) are coded here.Example: Rwandan rebels announced that President Kagame and his Rwandan Patriotic Front must agree to major constitutional changes before they demobilize.\n\n\n\nDemand that target yields\nCode: 105Description: Require, demand that target yields or concedes, not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event type may or may not be one of the adversaries; a third party could also be demanding that one or more of the parties in conflict (who are coded as targets) to yield. When a threat is attached to a demand for yielding, the appropriate code under category 13 should be used instead. Also, if accompanied by some form of protest activity, codes under category 14 should be used. When yielding actually takes place, use the appropriate code under category 08.Example: The United States on Thursday demanded that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) forsake its nuclear program. Note: Because no military engagement has yet occurred, this default code is used instead of 1056.\n\nDemand easing of administrative sanctions\nCode: 1051Description: Require, demand that target relaxes administrative restrictions.Usage Notes: Use this code when a government is pushed to undertake some political changes that clearly constitute some form of concession or yielding, such as relaxing or removing bans, curfews, or other restrictions that are already in place. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead.Example: Human rights organization Amnesty International demanded that the Sudanese government end curbs on press freedom.\n\n\nDemand easing of political dissent\nCode: 1052Description: Require, demand that target stops political protest activities.Usage Notes: Use this code for demands that the target stop engaging in protests, demonstrations, strikes, etc. Note that this code refers exclusively to verbal demands; if the source actively seeks to stop activities through repressive measures, 175 is used instead.Example: Iranian authorities have been pressuring workers of the United Bus Company of Tehran (Sharekat-e Vahed) to cancel the strike they have been planning for better pay and working conditions.\n\n\nDemand release of persons or property\nCode: 1053Description: Require, demand that target releases persons or property.Usage Notes: Use this code for demands that the target release prisoners, hostages, and any confiscated property.Example: Russia said on Tuesday that Sudan must return a Mi-26 helicopter that was captured by the Sudanese authorities last week.\n\n\nDemand easing of economic sanctions, boycott, or embargo\nCode: 1054Description: Require, demand that target lifts or eases economic sanctions, boycott, or embargo.Usage Notes: Use this code only for economic sanctions, boycotts, or embargoes.Example: The 106th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference stressed the obligation of the international community to take immediate action to lift embargoes and other sanctions which have negatively affected children in different parts of the world.\n\n\nDemand that target allows international involvement (non-mediation)\nCode: 1055Description: Require, demand that target allow access to international actors, such as observers, humanitarian agencies, and peacekeeping forces.Usage Notes: Demands for adversaries to allow mediation are coded as 108 instead.Example: Kenzo Oshima, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, demanded parties to the conflict in Iraq to allow humanitarian workers the freedom of movement necessary for discharging their mandate.\n\n\nDemand de-escalation of military engagement\nCode: 1056Description: Require, demand that target stops fighting or takes measures to ease military conflict or tension.Usage Notes: Use this code for demands for ceasefires, military withdrawals, and demobilization.Example: Washington along with its allies demanded that Hamas renounce its armed struggle against Israel.\n\n\n\nDemand meeting, negotiation\nCode: 106Description: Require, order party(ies) to meet, negotiate.Usage Notes: This event form can be initiated by either the adversaries or other third parties.Example: Yugoslavia on Tuesday demanded a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Croatia’s military advance into the Serb-held Krajina region, describing it as “a serious challenge to the world community.”\n\n\nDemand settling of dispute\nCode: 107Description: Order parties to a conflict to reach a settlement, agreement, or resolution of conflict.Usage Notes: This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Note that the source for this event cannot be the adversaries themselves. When one or more parties to a conflict call for ending the conflict, that is taken to be an expression of intent on the part of that source actor and is thus coded as 037 instead.Example: Jack Straw said on Friday that the Sudanese government and the rebels in Darfur must reach an agreement that stops the conflict for good before developmental assistance to the region is released. Note: Because of the compound target, two separate events are coded.\n\n\nDemand mediation\nCode: 108Description: Require or demand that a third party mediates a conflict or that adversaries accept mediation of another party.Usage Notes: This event form is a verbal act. It specifically refers to demands by actors other than potential mediators; either the adversaries or a prospective mediator can be coded as the target.Example: Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said here Wednesday that the US must be ready to mediate between Israelis and Palestinians as soon as the Israeli elections of January 28 are finalized."

Use this event form to code instances where one party (the source) solicits third parties to express disapproval of, protest against, or punish another party (the target). Note that only diplomatic solicitations‚Äînot military mobilizations‚Äîshould be coded here.Example: An official Syrian newspaper called Thursday on Arabs to unite and “mobilize” against Israeli right-winger Ariel Sharon, who has vowed not to return the Golan Heights to Syria if he is elected prime minister February 4.\n\n\nComplain officially\nCode: 114Description: Written and institutionalized protests, appeals, and all petition drives and recalls.Usage Notes: NULLExample: Yugoslavia lodged an official protest with Albania today, charging its neighbor with supporting dissidents here in what is said was tantamount to inciting revolution.\n\n\nBring lawsuit against\nCode: 115Description: Sue, file civil or criminal lawsuit at domestic or international courts.Usage Notes: Source must be the plaintiff or the state and target must be the defendant.Example: A Saudi businessman is suing the United States for damages to his pharmaceutical plant which were caused by a missile attack in August, his American lawyer said.\n\n\nfind guilty or liable (legally)\nCode: 116Description: Find guilty or liable at a court of law.Usage Notes: Source must be the court in question, which could be domestic or international, and target must be the defendant.

Note that while the host country should be coded as the source actor when coding an expulsion of peacekeeping forces, the provider of the forces becomes the source when coding withdrawals.Example: Eighty UN peacekeepers were shipped out of the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde Friday, leaving just 100 UN troops to follow them out later this month.\n\n\nExpel or withdraw inspectors, observers\nCode: 1662Description: Terminate the presence of inspectors or other observers.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code both expulsions by host countries and withdrawals by providers of inspectors or observers.Example: North Korea expelled inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, from frozen nuclear facilities at Yongbyon after U.S. officials alleged that the North admitted it had a uranium-based program in late 2002.\n\n\nExpel or withdraw aid agencies\nCode: 1663Description: Terminate the presence of aid agencies or other non-governmental organizations helping civilians.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code both expulsions by host countries and withdrawals by providers of humanitarian aid. When aid is simply reduced or halted but the expulsion or withdrawal of the provider is not mentioned, use 1623 instead.Example: Jakarta forced the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, out of the country following the relief operation, although it had more than ¬£12m of unspent donations."

Note that if the event is about the actual enforcement of such restrictions through repressive tactics, such as imprisonments and dispersion of demonstrations, 175 should be used instead.Example: The British government on Monday outlawed the largest Protestant extremist organization in Northern Ireland because of what it called its direct involvement in killing in the strife-torn province.\n\n\nBan political parties or politicians\nCode: 1722Description: Prevent establishment or activities of political parties or politicians.Usage Notes: NULLExample: President Yoweri Museveni has banned Ugandan opposition candidates from participating in the upcoming elections.\n\n\nImpose curfew\nCode: 1723Description: Set a deadline beyond which inhabitants of an area are not permitted to be on the streets or in public places.Usage Notes: NULLExample: Turkish authorities have imposed a curfew in the town of Cizre in southeastern Turkey after a demonstration over fraud allegations in Sunday’s local elections, security sources said here Tuesday.\n\n\nImpose state of emergency or martial law\nCode: 1724Description: Suspend normal constitutional rights and provisions by installing state of emergency or military rule.Usage Notes: NULLExample: The military government of President Prosper Avril declared a 30-day state of siege in Haiti on Saturday, suspending parts of the constitution and arresting political opponents, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy said.\n\n\n\nArrest, detain, or charge with legal action\nCode: 173Description: Legal or extrajudicial arrests, detentions, or imprisonments.Usage Notes: Use this code for both criminal and political detentions. Note, however, that taking of hostages is coded as 181 instead, and charges or lawsuits are coded as 115.Example: Israeli soldiers arrested more than 100 Palestinians on Saturday in a security sweep of the Hebron area of the occupied West Bank, military sources said.\n\n\nExpel or deport individuals\nCode: 174Description: Formal removal or expulsion of individuals from territories, typically following legal proceedings.Usage Notes: Expulsion of diplomats constitute reduction of diplomatic relations and should be coded as ‘Reduce or break diplomatic relations’ (161). Expulsion of peacekeepers, inspectors, or aid agencies refer to category 164. Mass political expulsions, with the purpose of ethnic cleansing for instance, are coded as 201 instead.Example: Ghanaian authorities have deported 168 Liberians for traveling without proper documents on a Swedish-registered vessel, a port official said Monday.\n\n\nUse tactics of violent repression\nCode: 175Description: Actively repress collective actions of dissent by forcing subjugation through crowd control tactics, arrests, etc.Usage Notes: Note the difference between repression of dissidents and military engagements.Example: Liberian riot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting election results in Monrovia."

    "section": "ASSAULT",
    "text": "ASSAULT\n\nUse unconventional violence\nCode: 180Description: Use of unconventional forms of violence which do not require high levels of organization or conventional weaponry, not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code use of forms of force and violence that do not require high levels of organization typical of state-military establishments. Terrorist attacks, if not further specified, should be coded here. Use this default code also for use of knives, rocks and other such unsophisticated weapons. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 181-186 cannot be made.Example: A temporary camp for Congolese refugees was attacked by Burundian militiamen armed with machetes, killing at least 156 people, the UN refugee agency reported.\n\n\nAbduct, hijack, or take hostage\nCode: 181Description: Kidnap, take hostage, hijack, or forcibly seize control of an aircraft, car, bus, ship, etc.Usage Notes: NULLExample: Afghan rebels have kidnapped up to 16 Soviet civilian advisers from a town bazaar and exploded a series of bombs in the capital Kabul, western diplomatic sources in neighboring Pakistan said today.\n\n\nPhysically assault\nCode: 182Description: Attack physical well-being of individuals without the use of weaponry, not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This event form category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. Beatings are coded here.Example: Israeli soldiers routinely beat up Palestinian detainees on the occupied West Bank with the knowledge of senior officers, a court martial was told today.\n\nSexually assault\nCode: 1821Description: Sexually abuse, assault sexual integrity of individuals.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code rapes and other sexual assaults.Example: U.S. border patrol agents sexually abused illegal Mexican immigrants with impunity, a human rights organization charged on Saturday.\n\n\nTorture\nCode: 1822Description: Torture, inflict extreme pain on individuals.Usage Notes: The distinction between 1822 and the default code 182 depend primarily on the particular terminology used by reporters. This code is used typically when “torture” is mentioned in the lead.Example: Security forces in Guinea have tortured scores of Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees, whom authorities blame for a border conflict, Human Rights Watch (HWR) said Thursday.\n\n\nKill by physical assault\nCode: 1823Description: Kill individuals by physically assaulting them without the use of weaponry, through beating, torture, lynching, etc.Usage Notes: When a physical assault‚Äîbeating, torture, lynching, etc.‚Äìis specifically mentioned to have caused death, this code takes precedence over other codes for physical assault.Example: A Palestinian prisoner died as a result of torture while in Israeli police custody, according to a report by a pathologist sent to Israel by Physicians for Human Rights.\n\n\n\nConduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing\nCode: 183Description: Use improvised explosives or makeshift bombs not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: Aerial bombings that involve the use of aircrafts are coded as 195 instead.Example: Irish nationalist guerrillas wounded two British soldiers in a bomb attack on Thursday, police said.\n\nCarry out suicide bombing\nCode: 1831Description: Carry out bomb attack with the intention of causing own death as well as other casualties.Usage Notes: Not every attack that results in the assailant’s death is necessarily a suicide attack; we rely on the terminology used by reporters to make that call‚Äîwe code bombings as suicide bombings if the report identifies it as such.Example: Two Palestinian suicide bombers killed 23 people as well as themselves late Sunday when they blew themselves up in Tel Aviv in the second-worst attack in the current Palestinian uprising, police said.\n\n\nCarry out car bombing\nCode: 1832Description: Blow up a car or other vehicle to cause damage to surroundings.Usage Notes: If a car bombing is also known to have been a suicide attack, the suicide component takes precedence and the event is coded as 1831.Example: A prominent anti-Syria journalist has been killed in a car bomb explosion in a residential sector of mostly Christian eastern Beirut.\n\n\nCarry out roadside bombing\nCode: 1833Description: Detonate explosives on the roadside to cause damage and casualties to passers-by.Usage Notes: These bombs or explosives are typically left along the roads by assailants long before they are detonated, hence reports of such attacks can rarely credibly identify the actors responsible for placing those explosives. Therefore, the particular locations of such attacks are typically coded as source actors.Example: A roadside bombing near the town of Samarra on Sunday killed one U.S. soldier and wounded two others, the military said.\n\n\n\nUse as human shield\nCode: 184Description: Use civilians as buffer on the front lines or in other dangerous environments.Usage Notes: NULLExample: The Sri Lankan army has been holding thousands of Tamil civilian refugees as human shields in the battle zones of the southern sector of the Jaffna peninsula, according to a press release by the Liberation Tigers.\n\n\nAttempt to assassinate\nCode: 185Description: Attempt but fail to kill politically significant and influential persons.Usage Notes: Use this code only when an assassination attempt or targeted killing is foiled; when assassinations are successfully carried out, 186 is used instead. This distinction is made because consequences of these two types of events could be significantly different. The source of this event would ideally be the assailant; however, in many cases this information will not be available and the location of the attack would be coded as the source instead.Example: An attempt to assassinate deputy governor of the Tyumen region, Oleg Chemezov, was thwarted in Khanty-Mansiysk (Siberia), the city’s police reported.\n\n\nAssassinate\nCode: 186Description: Kill politically significant and influential persons.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code targeted killings and assassinations of politically influential elites or leaders.Example: Hezbollah guerrillas killed the deputy chief of Israel’s militia ally in southern Lebanon Sunday sources on both sides said. Note: This example is coded as an assassination because of the position the victim held (which is explicitly reported)."

    "title": "Verb Codebook",
    "section": "FIGHT",
    "text": "FIGHT\n\nUse conventional military force\nCode: 190Description: All uses of conventional force and acts of war typically by organized armed groups not otherwise specified.Usage Notes: This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 191-196 cannot be made. In addition to unspecified acts of fighting, “killings” of any kind when the weapons used are not specified should also be coded here. When news leads refer to acts of killing that take place during an attack or some form of military engagement as “murders”, those should still be coded here. However, murders in general‚Äîas criminal acts with no political connotations‚Äîare not coded under the CAMEO framework. The first example below illustrates how one can differentiate between these two different uses of the verb “murder”.Example: One Serb policeman was murdered in an attack on a police patrol by Kosovo Albanians near the border with Kosovo, state agency Tanjug reported Sunday.\n\n\nImpose blockade, restrict movement\nCode: 191Description: Prevent entry into and/or exit from a territory using armed forces.Usage Notes: Note that this event form is different from code 144 (‘Obstruct physically’), which refers to civilian protest activities that seek to disrupt routine and normal proceedings.Example: Israel Friday reimposed blockades in the West Bank following the shooting deaths of two Israelis a day earlier, a military spokesman announced.\n\n\nOccupy territory\nCode: 192Description: Occupy, seize control of a territory using armed forces.Usage Notes: NULLExample: Vietnamese-led forces have retaken a strategic village in Western Kampuchea after fierce fighting with guerrillas who overran it late last month, Thai military sources said today.\n\n\nfight with small arms and light weapons\nCode: 193Description: Attack using small arms and light weapons such as rifles, machine-guns, and mortar shells.Usage Notes: Small arms include revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, sub-machine guns, assault rifles and light machine-guns. Light weapons include heavy-machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of anti-tank missile and rocket systems, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile system, and mortars of calibers less than 100 mm.Example: Sudanese rebels shelled the southern regional capital Juba for the first time in a year on Sunday and Monday, killing about 20 people, relief officials in Nairobi said.\n\n\nfight with artillery and tanks\nCode: 194Description: Attack using artillery, tanks, and rocket fire.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code military engagements that involve the use of guns of large caliber that are too heavy to carry, such as cannon or missile launchers that are not portable, and tanks and/or warships. When both small arms or light weapons and heavy weaponry are used, this code takes precedence.Example: Vietnamese-led forces launched artillery, mortar, and rocket fire against Kampuchean guerrilla camps near the eastern Thai border today, killing or wounding 50, Thai military sources said.\n\n\nEmploy aerial weapons\nCode: 195Description: Attack, bomb from air.Usage Notes: Use this event form to code bombings that involve the use of military air-crafts. When both aerial and other small types of weapons are used, this code takes precedence.Example: Soviet aircraft including helicopter gunships killed 46 Afghan civilians in an attack on a village in the western province of Heart.\n\n\nViolate ceasefire\nCode: 196Description: Reinitiate fighting in the midst of a formal or informal ceasefire or truce.Usage Notes: Regardless of how the ceasefire is broken and what kinds of weapons are used, all ceasefire and truce violations are coded here.Example: Both the Phillippines military and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front are guilty of violating the ceasefire agreement signed in March 2001, according to a group that conducted simultaneous fact-finding missions in Lanao, Maguindanao, and Cotabato provinces last week. Note: Two reciprocal events of the same type are coded."

Mass expulsions coded here are typically carried out with the intention of clearing out a particular group of people out of a specific area.Example: The Israeli army forced out on Wednesday more than 1,000 Palestinian refugees from their homes in a West Bank refugee camp during a 48-hour search for militants, residents said.\n\n\nEngage in mass killings\nCode: 202Description: Kill a substantial number of people, typically with the intention of ridding a territory of a particular group of people.Usage Notes: Politically motivated mass killings and genocides are coded here, relying primarily on the specific terminology used by reporters to identify an event that involves “mass” killings.Example: Sudan’s government is responsible for mass killings and other atrocities in the Darfur region, according to a United Nations report.\n\n\nEngage in ethnic cleansing\nCode: 203Description: Use mass expulsions and/or mass killings targeting a specific ethnic group.Usage Notes: When a report identifies mass expulsions or mass killings as being motivatedExample: Serb forces were engaged in ethnic cleansing in Kosovo against the majority Albanian population of the province, according to the US government.\n\n\nUse weapons of mass destruction\nCode: 204Description: Attack with unconventional weapons that are meant to cause massive destruction and casualties.Usage Notes: NULLExample: NULL\n\nUse chemical, biological, or radiological weapons\nCode: 2041Description: Attack using chemical, biological, or radiological weapons.Usage Notes: NULLExample: NULL\n\n\nDetonate nuclear weapons\nCode: 2042Description: Attack using nuclear weapons.Usage Notes: NULLExample: NULL\n\n\nReject judicial cooperation\nCode: 1213Description: Refuse to engage in or expand cooperation in judicial matters.Usage Notes: Use this code when the source actor refuses to cooperate in extraditions or other matters pertaining to legal proceedings.Example: Yugoslavia on Thursday flatly rejected an Australian ultimatum to handover a guard involved in a shooting in front of the Yugoslav consulate in Sydney."
