<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-public-statement">MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENT</h2>
<section id="make-statement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-statement">Make statement</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 010<br><strong>Description:</strong> All public statements expressed verbally or in action not otherwise specified.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 011 to 017 cannot be made. Note that statements are typically subordinate events; events such as comments are coded as mere statements only when they do not further imply appeals, agreements, support, apologies, demands, disapprovals, rejections, threats, etc.<br><strong>Example:</strong> U.S. military chief General Colin Powell said on Wednesday NATO would need to remain strong.</p>
</section>
<section id="decline-comment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decline-comment">Decline comment</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 011<br><strong>Description:</strong> Explicitly decline or refuse to comment on a situation.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is a verbal act. The target could be who the source actor declines to make a comment to or about.<br><strong>Example:</strong> NATO on Monday declined to comment on an estimate that Yugoslav army and special police troops in Kosovo were losing 90 to 100 dead per day in NATO air strikes.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-pessimistic-comment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-pessimistic-comment">Make pessimistic comment</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 012<br><strong>Description:</strong> Express pessimism, negative outlook.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is a verbal act. Only statements with explicit pessimistic components should be coded as 012; otherwise, default to 010.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Former West Germany Chancellor Willy Brandt said in a radio interview broadcast today he was skeptical over Moscow’s will to agree on limiting European-based nuclear weapons.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-optimistic-comment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-optimistic-comment">Make optimistic comment</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 013<br><strong>Description:</strong> Express optimism, assurance, confidence.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is a verbal act. Only statements with explicit optimistic components should be coded as 013; otherwise, default to 010.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Turkish President Turgut Ozal said on Wednesday he was confident that the United States would remove irritants damaging relations between the two NATO allies.</p>
</section>
<section id="consider-policy-option" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consider-policy-option">Consider policy option</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 014<br><strong>Description:</strong> Review, reflect upon, or study policy option.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. There is no limitation on types of policies that could be under consideration.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Europe’s leading security forum is exploring the possibility of international patrols to monitor the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia’s border with Serbia, its envoy said on Friday.</p>
</section>
<section id="acknowledge-or-claim-responsibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acknowledge-or-claim-responsibility">Acknowledge or claim responsibility</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 015<br><strong>Description:</strong> Non-apologetically claim responsibility, admit an error or wrongdoing, or retract a statement without expression of remorse.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is a verbal act. Remorseful acknowledgements should be coded as ‚ÄòApologize’ (064) instead.<br><strong>Example:</strong> A Damascus-based Palestinian guerrilla group claimed responsibility on Saturday for attacks on Israeli troops from Jordan in the past two days.</p>
</section>
<section id="deny-responsibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deny-responsibility">Deny responsibility</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 016<br><strong>Description:</strong> Discard or deny accusations or charges.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is a verbal act. The target for this event type is the party that introduces some accusation or charge against the source actor who denies responsibility.<br><strong>Example:</strong> The government of Liberia denied on Thursday charges by Ivory Coast that Monrovia is committing genocide.</p>
</section>
<section id="engage-in-symbolic-act" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="engage-in-symbolic-act">Engage in symbolic act</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 017<br><strong>Description:</strong> Engage in symbolic activities such as holding vigils, attending funerals, and laying wreath.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Use this event form for all symbolic acts, including those that imply empathy. Use 018 to code only empathetic comments (i.e.&nbsp;not actions).<br><strong>Example:</strong> NULL</p>
</section>
<section id="make-empathetic-comment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-empathetic-comment">Make empathetic comment</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 018<br><strong>Description:</strong> Express empathy, condolences, sympathy, understanding.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form refers exclusively to verbal acts or comments. Empathetic and other symbolic actions should be coded as 017 instead.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Saturday expressed condolences to the United States for the death of three American diplomats.</p>
</section>
<section id="express-accord" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="express-accord">Express accord</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 019<br><strong>Description:</strong> Express common understanding, agreement, or accord.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form refers exclusively to verbal acts or comments. Use this code when actors indicate that they simply agree or concur on an issue but do not imply commitment or intent to cooperate on that issue. These are typically reciprocal events (see example below) and require coding of more than one 018 event with actors reversed.<br><strong>Example:</strong> President Reagan and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak agreed today there was an urgent need for progress towards a Middle East settlement and that a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territories was also needed. Note: Two reciprocal events (both 018) are coded with actors reversed.</p>

<section id="appeal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal">APPEAL</h2>
<section id="make-an-appeal-or-request" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-an-appeal-or-request">Make an appeal or request</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 020<br><strong>Description:</strong> All requests, proposals, suggestions and appeals not otherwise specified.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 021 through 028 cannot be made. Events coded under this category refer to pleas made either on the source actor’s own behalf or on behalf of another party (i.e.&nbsp;the source asks that the target does something either for self or for a third party). Note that this and all the subcategories are distinct from demands, which are more forceful, and from pledges, which imply commitments, agreements, or promises on the part of the source actor.<br><strong>Example:</strong> NULL</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-material-cooperation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-material-cooperation">Appeal for material cooperation</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 021<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest material cooperation.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, though not exclusively, a verbal act. It refers to appeals for material cooperation specifically; appeals for diplomatic cooperation, such as for the provision of support on a particular policy, are coded as 022 instead. (Note that the actual events of material cooperation are coded under category 06.)<br><strong>Example:</strong> Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi on Monday urged Uganda to to repatriate “all Kenyan criminals hiding there” to face trial, accusing them of killing Kenyan policemen in cross-border raids recently.</p>
<section id="appeal-for-economic-cooperation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-economic-cooperation">Appeal for economic cooperation</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0211<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding economic ties.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Use this code for requests to develop or expand trade and other forms of economic exchange. Appeals for provision of economic aid-not mutual exchange-are coded as 0231 instead. Actual events of economic cooperation are coded as 061.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Indian business leaders Friday called for greater impetus towards free trade despite mounting tensions between India and Pakistan.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-military-cooperation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-military-cooperation">Appeal for military cooperation</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0212<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding military ties.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Use this code for requests to develop or expand military relations by engaging in acts such as joint military maneuvers or exercises. Appeals for provision of military aid-not mutual exchange-are coded as 0232 instead. Actual events of military cooperation are coded as 062.<br><strong>Example:</strong> South Korea has requested to lease a Russian military training ground, military officers in Seoul said on Thursday.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-judicial-cooperation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-judicial-cooperation">Appeal for judicial cooperation</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0213<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding cooperation in judicial matters.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Use this code for requests to develop or expand cooperation in such matters as extraditions. Appeals for information or other investigative tools, even if to be used in courts of law, are coded as 0214 instead. Note that in case of extraditions, the target for this event type is not the subject but the country he would be extradited to. Actual events of judicial cooperation are coded as 063.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Turkey renewed an appeal to Belgium to extradite a far-left militant wanted for murder, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Thursday, slamming what he called lax international cooperation against terrorism.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-intelligence" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-intelligence">Appeal for intelligence</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0214<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest sharing of intelligence.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Use this code for requests to develop or expand intelligence and information sharing. Actual events of intelligence cooperation are coded as 064.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Turkey said Monday it had asked Tehran and Damascus to provide urgent information about arms and ammunition seized last week in southeastern Turkey aboard six trucks travelling from Iran to Syria.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-diplomatic-cooperation-such-as-policy-support" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-diplomatic-cooperation-such-as-policy-support">Appeal for diplomatic cooperation (such as policy support)</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 022<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest expansion of diplomatic ties or cooperation.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. It refers to appeals for expanded diplomatic ties and non-tangible support on particular policies. Appeals for more specific forms of diplomacy, such as mediation and negotiation, are coded elsewhere within category 02.<br><strong>Example:</strong> North Korean state media have called on the United States to forge “ties of confidence” with Pyongyang ahead of six-party nuclear talks expected to be held in Beijing on July 26.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-aid" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-aid">Appeal for aid</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 023<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest provision of material assistance not otherwise specified.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. The source could be requesting aid for itself or on behalf of a third party; in either case, the actor whom the request is directed to should be coded as the target. Note that only requests for or suggestions of material aid are coded under this category; events coded under 023 imply neither the receipt or delivery of material aid nor a commitment on the part of the source actor to provide such aid. For the latter two cases, refer instead to categories 07 and 033, respectively.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Romania has asked the European Community for immediate delivery of additional aid, EC sources said on Thursday.</p>
<section id="appeal-for-economic-aid" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-economic-aid">Appeal for economic aid</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0231<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest economic assistance.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Requests or suggestions for loans or debt relief are also coded here. Appeals for reciprocal economic exchange, such as trade, should be coded as 0212 instead. The source could be requesting support for itself or on behalf of another party.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Russia and China will ask Asian banks to help finance construction of an $8 billion Trans-Siberian natural gas link to China. Note: Because of the compound source (Russia and China), two events are coded.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-military-aid" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-military-aid">Appeal for military aid</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0232<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest military assistance.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Requests for or suggestions of joint military actions, rather than unilateral military aid, should be coded as 0212 instead.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Angola has asked Portugal for military aid, especially instructors for its Soviet-and Cuban-trained armed forces, a Lisbon newspaper said today.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-humanitarian-aid" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-humanitarian-aid">Appeal for humanitarian aid</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0233<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest humanitarian assistance.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Requests for or suggestions of food, medicine, and related personnel, as well as shelter and protection, are all coded as 0233. Calls by refugees to be let into the territories of other countries (which should be coded as targets) and asylum requests all fit here.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Oxfam Canada today called on the world community to help save tens of thousands of Afghan civilians threatened with starvation.</p>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-military-protection-or-peacekeeping" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-military-protection-or-peacekeeping">Appeal for military protection or peacekeeping</h4>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0234<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest deployment of peacekeepers or other military forces to preserve peace, enforce ceasefires, or protect civilians.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source actor could be making the appeal for itself or on behalf of another party; the target should represent the actor who is expected to provide the forces.<br><strong>Example:</strong> A group of prominent Liberians have written to President George Bush urging him to send U.S. peacekeeping troops to their capital Monrovia.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="appeal-for-political-reform" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appeal-for-political-reform">Appeal for political reform</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 024<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest political change not otherwise specified.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for political change are coded under 104; expressions that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14. Source actors can be local citizens as well as international actors; they could be making the appeal on their own behalf or on behalf of others. Note that when the requested reform clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the target such as the easing of administrative sanctions, a more appropriate ‚ÄòAppeal’ code might be found under 025.<br><strong>Example:</strong> About 300 representatives from Egyptian civil society organizations submitted the most recent in a series of reform petitions, under the title “In Defense of the Nation” to the Saudi royal family.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> 0241<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest change in leadership or power.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful “demands” for leadership change are coded as 1041; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding change in leadership/power are coded under category 14.

More forceful “demands” for policy change are coded as 1042; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding change in leadership/power are coded under category 14. Just like the source actor, the policy in question can also be domestic or international in nature. If it is clear from the lead that by requesting certain policy changes the source is in fact appealing to the target to yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 035.<br><strong>Example:</strong> U.S. President George W.

More forceful “demands” for institutional change are coded as 1044; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding such change are coded under category 14. Institutional change is different from policy change in that the former directly alters the rules of the game. Requests for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g.&nbsp;democratization) as well as for more limited institutional changes (e.g.&nbsp;changing electoral law) are coded here.<br><strong>Example:</strong> President Emile Lahoud has pushed the Lebanese Parliament for a new election law two days before he is to call parliamentary elections.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> 025<br><strong>Description:</strong> Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target yields or concedes; not otherwise specified.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event type may or may not be one of the adversaries; a third party could also be appealing to one or more of the parties in conflict (who are coded as targets) to yield. When the source itself expresses its intent to yield‚Äîrather than requesting it from another party‚Äîthe event should be coded under 035 instead. When yielding actually takes place, use the appropriate code under category 08.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wants Germany to pay more compensation to the families of 11 Israeli athletes killed at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, a statement from his office said Tuesday.</p>

Note: While “disengagement” does not necessarily involve any kind of release of persons or property, in the case of Israel we can safely assume that any mention of the “disengagement plan” refers primarily to the withdrawal of settlements, hence, the return of land to the Palestinians; phrases involving “disengagement” or “settlements” can be entered into verb dictionaries, particularly the Middle East dictionary, as the appropriate codes pertaining to the release of property.</p>

Note that the source for this event cannot be the potential mediator or parties to the conflict. When an actor proposes to play the role of mediator himself, this is assumed to be a commitment on his part and is coded as 039 instead. When one or more of the adversaries request that another party plays the role of a mediator, this is understood to be a commitment on their part to accept mediation and is thus coded as 038. The target can either be a potential mediator (whose mediation is being requested) or one of the adversaries (who is requested to allow involvement of mediators).<br><strong>Example:</strong> The International Crisis Group has called on the UN stabilization mission in Haiti to broker an agreement among Haitians that “establishes common objectives for the next government.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="express-intent-to-meet-or-negotiate">Express intent to meet or negotiate</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 036<br><strong>Description:</strong> Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to meet, visit, or engage in talks or negotiations.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event code refers to future commitments to meet and/or negotiate; when meetings, negotiations, or other talks do take place, those are coded under category 04 instead. When mediation is mentioned specifically, appropriate mediation-related codes take precedence over meetings or negotiations.<br><strong>Example:</strong> East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer will visit Albania in June, the first Warsaw Pact foreign minister to do so since Tirana split with Moscow in 1961, the Albanian embassy said. Note: Given the wording of this lead, which implies that Albania has already committed to receive the German minister, two reciprocal events of 038 are coded with actors reversed. This example fits under this category since the future tense used implies a future commitment to meet.</p>

<section id="express-intent-to-settle-dispute" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="express-intent-to-settle-dispute">Express intent to settle dispute</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 037<br><strong>Description:</strong> Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to reach a comprehensive settlement, agreement, or resolution to conflict.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Note that specific commitments to yield, which might be present steps to settling disputes, are coded elsewhere under category 03. Both the source and the target for this event type should be adversaries themselves. When other parties make appeals to end disputes in which they are not directly involved, use ‚ÄòAppeal to others to settle dispute’ (027) instead.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Denmark today accepted a formula for ending its fisheries dispute with its European common market partners, government officials said.</p>

<section id="express-intent-to-accept-mediation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="express-intent-to-accept-mediation">Express intent to accept mediation</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 038<br><strong>Description:</strong> Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to accept mediation.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This code represents adversaries’ commitments to receive mediation by third parties. The latter should be coded as targets, while the source has to be one or more of the parties in conflict for this event. Note that when reports involve references to mediation specifically, mediation-related codes such as this take precedence over others, such as ‚ÄòAgree to meet or negotiate,’ ‚ÄòMake a visit,’ ‚ÄòHost a visit,’ and ‚ÄòMeet at a third location.’ For commitments by third parties to mediate refer to code 039 instead. For simple suggestions by actors other than adversaries and potential mediators that mediation occurs, use ‚ÄòAppeal to others to engage in or accept mediation’ (028).<br><strong>Example:</strong> Afghan rebel leaders said on Wednesday they would meet U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez if he gave them a veto over any settlement reached in peace talks.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> 039<br><strong>Description:</strong> Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to play the role of a mediator.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This code represents a commitment by third parties to mediate between parties in conflict. The former should be coded as source and the later as targets for this event. Note that when reports involve references to mediation specifically, mediation-related codes such as this take precedence over others, such as ‚ÄòAgree to meet or negotiate,’ ‚ÄòMake a visit,’ ‚ÄòHost a visit,’ and ‚ÄòMeet at a third location.’ For commitments of adversaries to accept mediation by actors other than the adversaries and potential mediators that mediation occurs, refer to ‚ÄòAppeal to others to engage in or accept mediation’ (028).<br><strong>Example:</strong> Gambian President Dawda Jawara will visit Mauritania and Senegal to mediate in a border dispute between the two West African neighbors, diplomatic sources said on Wednesday. Note: Given the wording used in this particular lead, which implies that Mauritania and Senegal have already agreed to Gambia’s mediation, two types of linked events are coded‚Äî‚ÄòExpress intent to mediate’ (036) with the Gambian president as the source, and ‚ÄòExpress intent to accept mediation’ (035) with Mauritania and Senegal as sources. Two different events are coded for each of these event types since Mauritania and Senegal are compound actors.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> 040<br><strong>Description:</strong> All consultations and meetings not otherwise specified.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 041 through 044 cannot be made. Note that events coded under 04 are typically, although not always, reciprocal events.<br><strong>Example:</strong> A group of African diplomats held their first meeting with President Parvanov at a lunch hosted by the Ambassador of Kingdom of Morocco. Note: This lead is coded as 040 since the place of the meeting is not explicit in the lead, hence we cannot code it as a visit made or hosted, and no negotiations are implied (so, we cannot code it as ‚ÄòEngage in negotiation’).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discuss-by-telephone">Discuss by telephone</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 041<br><strong>Description:</strong> Consult, talk on the telephone.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This is typically a reciprocal event. The nature of the phone conversation is not of significance.<br><strong>Example:</strong> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Tuesday to discuss efforts to forge a peace settlement in former Yugoslavia, Itar-Tass news agency said. Note: Two events of the same type are coded with actors reversed.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> 042<br><strong>Description:</strong> Travel to another location for a meeting or other event.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> All visits and travels should be coded under this category. Note that this event is typically accompanied by the linked event ‚ÄòHost a visit’ (043). If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Taiwan’s Vice Foreign Minister visited Russia today, becoming the island’s highest ranking government official to go there. Note: Two events are coded: 042 with the Taiwanese government as the source and Russia as the target, and 043 with actors reversed.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meet-at-a-third-location">Meet at a ‘third’ location</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 044<br><strong>Description:</strong> Meet, come together, gather with others at a neutral location, some place with which none of the attending parties are associated. If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event type is typically accompanied by two other linked events, ‚ÄòMake a visit’ (042) and ‚ÄòHost a visit’ (043), and the event itself is reciprocal. For 044, the source and the target are the actors who are meeting; the location of the meeting is ignored.<br><strong>Example:</strong> U.S. and Soviet negotiators return to Geneva this week for talk on limiting the number of European-based nuclear missiles, an issue likely to dominate East-West relations this year. Note: Six events are coded: two reciprocal ‚ÄòMeet at a third location’ events with US and the Soviet Union as actors; two ‘‚ÄòMake a visit’ events with Switzerland as the target, and the US and the Soviet Union as the two different sources; and two ‚ÄòHost a visit’ events with Switzerland as the source and the US and the Soviet as the two different targets.</p>

<section id="mediate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mediate">Mediate</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 045<br><strong>Description:</strong> Mediate between two or more parties.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event code should be used only when a party meets with others explicitly as a mediator. The source is always the mediator and adversaries are the targets. All other cases of meetings and negotiations, where the purpose of the meeting or the role of the source actor is not specified, should be coded elsewhere under category 04. If meetings, discussions, or negotiations are explicitly reported as involving mediators, the mediation code takes precedence as long as the party acting as the mediator is identified in the lead.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Arab League Secretary General Chadli Klibi undertook mediation mission between Syria and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Note: Because of the compound target actor, two events are coded.</p>

<section id="engage-in-negotiation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="engage-in-negotiation">Engage in negotiation</h3>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 046<br><strong>Description:</strong> Negotiate or bargain with others.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> This event code should be used only when the report makes clear that negotiations, bargaining, or discussions are involved in the meetings or consultations in question. “Holding talks” and “discussions” are treated as negotiations. These are reciprocal events.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Israel and Lebanon renewed negotiations today on an Israeli troop pullback from Lebanon and their future relations.

Use this code only for political, diplomatic, and non-material defense; military cooperation or defense should be coded elsewhere.<br><strong>Example:</strong> The United States on Thursday defended the right of Soviet troops to fire protectively on militants in Azerbaijan and insisted unrest there reflected age-old ethnic tensions, not a fight for political independence.</p>

Events should be coded under this category only when agreements are reportedly finalized or signed. This event code is typically reciprocal. Even when the agreement in question implies a formal commitment to boost material cooperation, provide aid, or yield in some way, the event of signing the agreement or treaty is still coded here since signing of an agreement or treaty represents diplomatic cooperation but does not guarantee implementation‚Äî whatever its terms.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov today signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, the BTA reported.

<p><strong>Code:</strong> 1833<br><strong>Description:</strong> Detonate explosives on the roadside to cause damage and casualties to passers-by.<br><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> These bombs or explosives are typically left along the roads by assailants long before they are detonated, hence reports of such attacks can rarely credibly identify the actors responsible for placing those explosives.

This distinction is made because consequences of these two types of events could be significantly different. The source of this event would ideally be the assailant; however, in many cases this information will not be available and the location of the attack would be coded as the source instead.<br><strong>Example:</strong> An attempt to assassinate deputy governor of the Tyumen region, Oleg Chemezov, was thwarted in Khanty-Mansiysk (Siberia), the city’s police reported.</p>
