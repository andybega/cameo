Mobilize or increase cyber-forces,155,,Increase the capacity to wage cyber-warfare.,"This event can only be coded when the move is directed against a specific target or targets, whether as an o↵ensive or defensive move.","North Korea has trained more than 500 computer hackers capable of launching cyber warfare against the United States, South Korea’s defense ministry said Monday."
Attack cybernetically,176,,"Illegal or unauthorized attack on computers, networks, or accounts.","Cyberattacks can be any of a wide range of acts, with an even wider range of motives. Vandalism of websites, theft of private electronic information, and the hostile shutting-down of networks all fit under this category.","Muslim hackers angered by the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed have defaced nearly 3,000 Danish Web sites over the past month in the biggest politically motivated cyber attack long-time observers have ever seen."
Carry out location bombing,1834,,The use of pre-placed explosive device(s) with the intent of causing casualties and or/structural damage.,"The distinguishing factors for this code are the presence of placed munitions detonated either remotely or according to pre-set conditions (time, proximity, movement of the device, etc.). Suicide, vehicular bombing components, or roadside locations take precedence and are coded 1831, 1832 and 1833 respectively. Minefield casualties and the deployment of mines are specifically excluded from this code and are coded as 193 (Fight with small arms and light weapons) instead.","Three US servicemen were killed by an improvised explosive device outside

The weapons themselves must have guidance capability and should be differentiated from ”surgical aerial attacks” which are otherwise coded under the default 195.,British aircraft using precision guided missiles killed 4 Iraqis in an attack on a suspected weapons supply in Basra.
Employ precision-guided aerial munitions,1952,,The use of remotely piloted or unmanned aerial platforms for the delivery or ordinance.,Use this event form to code aerial attacks that involve the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles.
